# vue-markup

> A markup editor build with VueJS 2.

The code is divided into the `application` part where the VueJS app is and the `api` part where the NodeJS service is. Every part has its own `README.md` file.

Right now the POC phase is completed and the editor can be used for live
Markdown to HTML Conversion.

## Todo for MVP:
- [ ] UI (navbar , themes and co)
- [ ] Mobile UI
- [ ] To PDF, HTML and Markdown export
- [ ] Github project README.md importer
- [ ] Server side rendering for bigger projects
- [ ] Tabs / Pagination for multiple projects
- [ ] Google Drive / Dropbox import and export
- [ ] Multi Person Editing
- [ ] Save Session
- [ ] Import Markdown file

Every TODO will be implemented in separate branches with unit tests for every feature.
